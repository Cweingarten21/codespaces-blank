            <p><br/>
                The Mighty Ducks is a great movie about a youth hockey team in Minnesota that tackes on an new hockey coach that frankly hates the game. Ther coach and the team do grow on eachother and they end up winning the youth hockey championship. This is a great movie about working hard and never giving up.
