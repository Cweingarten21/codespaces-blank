                <h2>A Review of HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML is really a very simple scripting language. It consists of ordinary text, with elements that are
                    enclosed by
                    "<" and ">" characters. The best part about HTML is that once we know how to effectively us basic
                        elements, we can look up how to use all the others! </p>

            <h3><u>Links</u></h3>
            <p>Links are very useful, and help users to quickly navigate to new pages, both within and outside of the
                current website.<br />
                For instance, the can quickly direct users to <a href="https://www.google.com/?safe=active&ssui=on" ,
                target="_blank">Google's Homepage.</a><br>
                <a href="mailto:cweingarten@student.mamkschools,org">Emails</a> can also be easily sent through the use
                of links. <br />
                <a href="#Title and Desciption" , target="_self">They can even bring a user to a certian place within a

            title="Image of Mamaronekc Tigers Logo" />
            <p>Sometimes we want to go ahead and align pictures to the left of a line of text. Using the "align"
            attribute, with a value of "left" is a perfect way to do this. You could also align the pictures to
            the right of text by replacing the value in the "align" attribute to "right". </p><br>
