            <p>Miracle is a movie about the 1980 US olympic hockey team that defeated all odds to win the semifinals against in that time the best team in the world, the Soviets, <br/>and then went on to win the gold medal against Sweden. This movie is a great example of pure determination and not giving up despite the odds. </p>
