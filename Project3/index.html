            <p>Miracle is a movie about the 1980 US olympic hockey team that defeated all odds to win the semifinals against in that time the best team in the world, the Soviets, and then went on to win the gold medal against Sweden. This movie is a great example of pure determination and not giving up despite the odds. </p>
