        <h2>A Review of HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is really a very simplescripting language. It consists of ordinary text, with elemnts that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters. <br/>The best part about HTML is that once we know how to effectively us basic elements, we can look up how to use all the others.</p>
